- pi needs internet to set time
- trip cable for wired internet cover?
- logos on web page
- password for solar wifi: "then cas"
- sodec network ability to log in remotely?
- update pi server AGAIN

configure eGauge.
- add all devices
- virtuals: whole-house energy use?
- water supply + booster
- lighting 1 + 2

okay, let's work this out.

red_main_ct * L1 + black_main_ct * L2 = net energy from electric company

red_overhead_ct * L1 + black_overhead_ct * L2 = net energy from overhead
** ALTERNATIVELY, USE (- red_overhead_ct) in place of black_overhead_ct

red_bifacial_ct * L1 + black_bifacial_ct * L2 = net energy from bifacial
** ALTERNATIVELY, USE (- red_bifacial_ct) in place of black_bifacial_ct


use closure compiler to check for obvious static errors


order of events on-site:
- power on
- egauge configuration
- power for wireless router
- password for wireless router
- power & network for raspberry pi
- update software
- enable data echo? (could be a bad idea with no network?)
- t/h sensors
- install autossh
- zero out database

-- for tunnel: be sure to get it set up right, test to local machine before pointing at cpsd
- gotchas:
  - log in by hand to get host into known_hosts
  - -t -t to force creation of tty
  - ownership of key file

When we get network:
disable mock data on cpsd, zero out databases,
