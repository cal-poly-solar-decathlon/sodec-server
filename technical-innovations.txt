Monitoring and Data Collection

From Nest to Wink to Z-Wave, the "Smart Home" movement is a prominent topic
today. One problem with many of these systems is that they must make decisions
based on extremely limited input data.

In an effort to overcome this, Solar Cal Poly has designed a house that
is "Pre-Instrumented" with a network of built-in temperature, humidity,
power generation, and power use sensors. This network is connected to a
central low-power server that collects this data, and served from there
to an App running on a tablet device.

The house performs long-term data collection. This makes it possible to
apply data-mining techniques; are certain days more power-hungry than
others? Are there some rooms that use disproportionate amounts of energy?
Would it be possible to lower the temperature in rooms not likely to
be occupied in the next few hours? Long-term monitoring makes it possible
to answer all of these questions, in a way that is tailored to one particular
family.
