What follows are the expected power & network connections for the control
systems that I'm aware of (I know nothing of lighting, for instance).

I think most of this is going to be obvious, but I'll write it all up just to
be sure.

POWER:

- eGauge gets power from mains
- Raspberry Pi gets standard USB 5v using micro-usb, using supplied cable &
  adapter
- Arduino Mega gets 5v from goofy hacked-up power supply from Tim (or we could
  probably hack something together from a consumer USB adapter, sigh)
- wireless router has its own (19V?) power supply (labeled "asus", with blue
  light)
- ethernet switch has its own power supply (ribbed, IIRC ...)
- everything else (remote temp/hum sensors) get power via existing Cat5

NETWORK:

- exterior-grade Cat5 connects grid to WAN port of wireless router
- Cat5 from router LAN port to ethernet switch WAN port
- Cat5 from *either* router or switch LAN ports to the following
   * raspberry Pi
   * arduino mega
   * egauge 1
   * egauge 2
   * anything else needed by others on the project (consumer laptop?)
- custom Cat5 from arduino mega to 4 remote temp/hum sensors throughout the
  house.
