- sodec network ability to log in remotely?
- update pi server AGAIN

configure eGauge.
- add all devices
- virtuals: whole-house energy use?
- water supply + booster
- lighting 1 + 2

okay, let's work this out.

red_main_ct * L1 + black_main_ct * L2 = net energy from electric company

red_overhead_ct * L1 + black_overhead_ct * L2 = net energy from overhead
** ALTERNATIVELY, USE (- red_overhead_ct) in place of black_overhead_ct

red_bifacial_ct * L1 + black_bifacial_ct * L2 = net energy from bifacial
** ALTERNATIVELY, USE (- red_bifacial_ct) in place of black_bifacial_ct


use closure compiler to check for obvious static errors
