John,


I am using the circuits assuming they are the same as the list you sent.  To make sure things are clear I have updated the list with the circuit description if these have been moved

Mains Red -  100A
Mains Black - 100A

1.   50A  (Dryer/Washer)
2 - 20A   (Dishwasher)
3 - 20A    (Refrigerator)
4 - 50A  (Cooktop) 
5 - 20A  (Solar Water Heater)
16 - 20A   (Mechanical Room Receptacles)
19 - 20A   (Grey Water Pump)
20 - 20A  (Black Water Pump)
21 - 20A  (Thermal Loop Pump)
22 - 20A  (Water Supply Pump)
23 - 20A  (Microwave)
25 - 20A   (HRV)
26 - 20A  (Water Supply Booster Pump)
27 - 50A    (A/C)   (may be fine with a 20A but not sure of the AC specs)
28 - 20A   (Air Handler Receptacles)
31 - 20A   (Lighting)
32 - 20A   (Lighting)
35  -  20A  (PV Inverter)
36 - 50A   (PV Inverter)
40   -   20A   (Vehicle Charging Station)

35 & 36 are the Inverters.   The 5000W inverter connected to the bifacial panels should use the 50A CT and the 4000W Inverter connected to the Sunpower panels should use a 20A CT.   I am not sure which circuit is connected to which inverter

This leaves us with 2 more 20A CTs to use to monitor receptacles.
Possible choices are  8,9,10,12,13,14,15
