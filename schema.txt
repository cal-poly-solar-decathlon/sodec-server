Server storage schema

Table: SENSOR EVENTS

columns:
- unique id (unique key)
- date : DATE
- device : VARCHAR(64)
- reading : 64-bit INTEGER

the idea is that this table will just pile up sensor events. There's a
temptation to implement some kind of run-length-encoding to avoid piles
and piles of data, but I think for now this is the easier solution.

Also, note that I'm specifying the reading as an integer; I think this strikes
a good balance between filterability (give me all the readings higher than x)
and flexibility (different sensors can encode their readings in different
ways).

Table: CONTROL EVENTS

columns:
- unique id (unique key)
- date : DATE
- device : VARCHAR(64)
- setting : 64-bit INTEGER

Yes, this looks a lot like the sensor events table; I think it makes sense
to record these in a different table, but I'd be open to discussion.
